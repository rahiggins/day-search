    Second recipe parse starts with paragraph containing the third recipe name

    this paragraph and added to accumRecipeName.
    The next (preceeding) paragraph parsed: 'Adapted from David Pasternack, chef at Esca.'

    The next (preceeding) paragraph parsed: 'Pickled Jerusalem Artichokes 3 cups water ...'

    The next (preceeding) paragraph parsed: '2. Pass the artichokes and potatoes ... Serves 4.'
