    the autohr name paragraph were skipped until a paragraph without terminal

    taken as the recipe name.

seq: 156, article: Kitchen Voyeur: The Original 'Unoriginal'
    First recipe: Recipe Name not found

    Paragraph that contains the recipe name also contains the ingredients
    list. But because the paragraph does not include 'time' or 'adapted' 
    phrases, the paragraph is emptied (adjustParaText(), attribution 
    check) discarding the recipe name.

    Second recipe: recipe name plus ingredients list

    Same situation as the first recipe, but because the paragraph that
    precedes the recipe name contains an endOfRecipe marker and the 
    accumRecipeName array is empty, the paragraph previously exmained
    is taken as the recipe name, including the ingredients list.

    The following attribution check code solves this article, but breaks
    many other articles that have a recipe name paragraph followed by
    an ingredients list paragraph that starts with an unquantified 
    ingredient, which is appended to the recipe name.

    if (paraText.length > 0) {
      // If, after slicing off the ingredients list, the paragraph
      //  text is not empty, the paragraph may contain the recipe
      //  name.
      // Check the paragraph text for the case-insensitive phrases
      //  'total time:', 'time:', 'adapted', or 'from'.
      let attribution = paraText.match(/(total )*(time:)|(adapted)|(from)/i)
      if (attribution != null) {
        // If the paragraph text does contain one of those phrases,
        //  then discard the that starts with that phrase and
        //  return only the text that preceeds that phrase.
        paraText = paraText.substring(0, attribution.index)
        console.log("(ingredients found) Paragraph text trimmed at '" + attribution[0])
      }
    }

    This code can be used if the unquantified first ingredient problem is
    solved.

seq: 161, article: The Arsenal
    First recipe: Recipe Name not found

    Recipe name followed by text ending in teminal punctuation, so the
    recipe name paragraph is skipped.

    Last three recipes: Recipe name paragraph also contains text or
    ingredients list.  Preceding paragraph contains endOfRecipe, so
    entire recipe name paragraph is taken as recipe name.

    phrases, the paragraph is emptied (adjustParaText(), attribution

    Other recipes: recipe name plus ingredients list

    Same situation as the first recipe, but because the paragraph that
    precedes the recipe name contains an endOfRecipe marker and the 
    accumRecipeName array is empty, the paragraph previously exmained
    is taken as the recipe name, including the ingredients list.

    Second recipe: Recipe name followed by ingredients list

    Paragraph that contains the recipe name also contains the ingredients
    list. But because the paragraph does not include 'time' or 'adapted' 
    phrases, the paragraph is not not recognized as containing the recipe
    name and is discarded.  The next paragraph examined contains an    
    endOfRecipe marker and the accumRecipeName array is empty, so
    the paragraph previously exmained is taken as the recipe name,
