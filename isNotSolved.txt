    The next (preceeding) paragraph parsed: '2. Pass the artichokes and potatoes ... Serves 4.'

    The recipe name paragraph includes a 'For the _' phrase and an ingredients list,

    Last (fifth) recipe: missing

    Demarcation is 'instr'. Last recipe has no recipe markers.

Seq: 1824,  2000-04-19 Article: A Springtime Rite Worth a Year's Wait
    First recipe: text <recipe name>

    The recipe name was prepended to accumRecipeName.  The next paragraph parsed ended
    with `.' "`

    Because there is a space between the apostrophe and the quote, function adjustParaText
    does not expose the terminal punctuation, and the paragraph is prepended to accumRecipeName.

    The next paragraph parsed ends with terminal punctuation, ending the parse. Both elements
    in accumRecipeName are taken as the recipe name.

Seq: 1843,  2000-04-05 Article: Marinade
    First recipe: text

    The paragraph preceding the first ingredient has 'Recipe: The Marinade'. Function
    recipeParse strips 'Recipe:' and takes 'The Marinade' as the recipe title.  But the 
    article title 'Marinade' is preferred.

Seq: 1844,  2000-04-05 Article: Duck Breast
    First recipe: text

    The paragraph preceding the first ingredient has 'Recipe: Cooking the Duck Breast'. 
    Function recipeParse strips 'Recipe:' and takes 'The Marinade' as the recipe title.  
    But the article title 'Duck Breast' is preferred.

Seq: 1863,  2000-03-15 Article: THE MINIMALIST; A Surprise Candidate For Roasting
    First recipe: hasUnquantifiedIngredient missed

    First ingredient parsed (last ingredient) not recognized as a numbered ingredient:
    '1 3- to 4-pound boned lamb shoulder, trimmed of surface fat.'

        Ingredients match result: 1 3- to ,4-pound 
        Para contains ingredients
        Ingredient match: 4-pound  includes UOM: pound
        Number of ingredient matches: 2
        Number of matches including a measure: 1
        Half or so: 2

Seq: 1866,  2000-03-15 Article: THE CHEF; Minute Risotto (Almost)
    Third recipe: spurious

    Demarcation is 'end'. The article has 2 recipes, but the second recipe's first
    instruction step end with 'Makes about 2 cups.'. This is taken as an endOfRecipe
    marker (spurious).

    The parse starting at the spurious endOfRecipe marker finds the second recipe name.
    The parse starting at the actual endOfRecipe marker of the second recipe (Yield: 3 to 4 servings...)
    reaches the spurious endOfRecipe marker and backs up to the second recipe's second
    instruction step, which is taken as the (spurious) third recipe name.

Seq: 1878,  2000-03-01 Article: Gruyère Omelet
    First recipe: text

    Demarcation is 'servesMakes'.  First paragraph parsed is 'The Recipe', which is prepended
    to accumRecipeName. The next paragraph parsed ends with terminal punctuation, terminating
    the parse.  'The Recipe' is taken as the recipe name, but the actual recipe name is the
    article title.

    Do not prepended 'The Recipe'?

Seq: 1879,  2000-03-01 Article: Filled Omelet
    First recipe: text

    Demarcation is 'servesMakes'.  First paragraph parsed is 'The Recipe', which is prepended
    to accumRecipeName. The next paragraph parsed ends with terminal punctuation, terminating
    the parse.  'The Recipe' is taken as the recipe name, but the actual recipe name is the
    article title.

    Do not prepended 'The Recipe'?

Seq: 1963,  1999-04-11 Article: Food; Greek Fire
    Last recipe: Recipe name incomplete

    Function joinAccumRecipeName entered with -
        [ 'Psari Mayoneza', '(Fish With', 'Mayonnaise)' ]
    Last element of accumRecipeName dropped because lastAccumElementWords == 1

Seq: 1966,  1999-04-07 Article: THE CHEF
    hasUnquantifiedIngredient true, erroneously

    First recipe: 'For the _' phrases in the ingredients list lack a terminal colon.  They
    are therefore taken as unnumbered ingredients.

Seq: 1990,  1999-03-17 Article: THE MINIMALIST; The Tortilla As Omelet
    First recipe: hasUnquantifiedIngredient missed

    Demarcation is 'instr'.  First ingredient parsed ends with terminal punctuation and
    so is skipped.  The next ingredient is unnumbered, but because ingredients were not
    previously found, the unnumbered ingredient is not prepended to joinAccumRecipeName,
    and therefore in can't be recognized as an unnumbered ingredient.

Seq: 2020,  1999-02-17 Article: Magic Potions That Stir Food To Life
    First recipe: missed

    Demarcation is 'instr'.  The first recipe's instruction steps did not include A
    space after the instr marker, and so was not recognized as an instruction step.

    Second and third reported recipes: spurious

    Embedded in the recipes are two numbered lists, which are taken as recipes.

Seq: 2037,  1999-01-31 Article: FOOD; Love Me Tender
    First recipe: missed

    No recipe marker

Seq: 2056,  1999-01-13 Article: Where Indulgence Grows on Trees
    First recipe: hasUnquantifiedIngredient missed

    Demarcation is 'instr'.  First ingredient parsed ends with terminal punctuation and
    so is skipped.  The next ingredient is unnumbered, but because ingredients were not
    previously found, the unnumbered ingredient is not prepended to joinAccumRecipeName,
    and therefore in can't be recognized as an unnumbered ingredient.
