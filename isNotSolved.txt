    The paragraph preceeding the recipe name paragraph consists of the 
    author name.  This paragraph is discarded and the accumRecipeName

    1 Recipe name 'For the _:' is not checked for ingredients, but instead
    is discarded for terminal puntuation.  Discard for terminal punctuation
    continues to the beginning of the article, and the article name is used
    for the recipe name.
