The titleMatch processing in adjustTitle (lin.js) needs review.  The wild population of titles
 should be inventoried.

For fuzzy matches, verify that the target author is included and all or most nouns are present

For exact matches, verify that Featured Article matches

In renderer.js function displayArticle recipes loop, can Spectre.css column classes replace 
 float-left and {clear: left} divs?

Or, add <template> elements to index.html for repeated elements such as {clear: left} divs

In lib.js, function adjustParaText, can 'adapted' be handled in one place?
    Is there a better way to count the ingredient units of measure in the
    ingredient match results?
