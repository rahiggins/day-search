The titleMatch processing in adjustTitle (lin.js) needs review.  The wild population of titles
 should be inventoried.


In function processSectionOrKeywords, articlePage.goto sometimes goes to a 
    captcha page, instead of the article page.  The captcha page result can be
    detected because it has no div elements.

    1. Tell the NYT Day Search renderer process about the captcha page and wait
        for a response.
    2. In the NYT Day Search renderer process, listen for the captcha page
        notice.  When received, display a message about the captcha and add
        a button to the NYT Day Search window to be clicked after the captcha
        is solved. When the added button is clicked, send a response to the 
        main process.
    3. When the renderer process response is received by the main process, 
        repeat the articlePage.goto.
