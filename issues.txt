The titleMatch processing in adjustTitle (lib.js) needs review.  The wild population of titles
 should be inventoried.

For fuzzy matches, verify that the target author is included and all or most nouns are present

For exact matches, verify that Featured Article matches

In lib.js, function adjustParaText, can 'adapted' be handled in one place?
    Is there a better way to count the ingredient units of measure in the
    ingredient match results?

In lib.js, can the check for Serves and Makes be made case-insensitive?

In lib.js, adjustParaText() - ( still? ) When an ingredients list is sliced
    from a paragraph, if the first ingredient is unquantified, that
    ingredient will be left behind and will be included in the recipe name.

In lib.js, function adjustParaText,

    The following attribution check code solves this article [seq 156], but breaks
    many other articles that have a recipe name paragraph followed by
    an ingredients list paragraph that starts with an unquantified 
    ingredient, which is appended to the recipe name.

    if (paraText.length > 0) {
      // If, after slicing off the ingredients list, the paragraph
      //  text is not empty, the paragraph may contain the recipe
      //  name.
      // Check the paragraph text for the case-insensitive phrases
      //  'total time:', 'time:', 'adapted', or 'from'.
      let attribution = paraText.match(/(total )*(time:)|(adapted)|(from)/i)
      if (attribution != null) {
        // If the paragraph text does contain one of those phrases,
        //  then discard the that starts with that phrase and
        //  return only the text that preceeds that phrase.
        paraText = paraText.substring(0, attribution.index)
        console.log("(ingredients found) Paragraph text trimmed at '" + attribution[0])
      }
    }

    This code can be used if the unquantified first ingredient problem is
    solved.

    But seq 156 was fixed by the uncapitalized word check, so this is probably obsolete.
