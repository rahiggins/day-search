The titleMatch processing in index.js needs review.  The wild population of titles
 should be inventoried.

Testcase:   âœ“ 1) Because of addition of keyword searches, should check if an
                article has already been recorded.
            2) Integrate testcase here:
                a) add file-choser input from day-search-article-parse-test
                    to index.html
                b) delete input not chosen
                c) move recipeParse and para (and more?) to a separate file
                d) If the file-choser input was chosen, check if a test version
                    of that separate file exists and if so use that.


In function processSectionOrKeywords, articlePage.goto sometimes goes to a 
    captcha page, instead of the article page.  The captcha page result can be
    detected because it has no div elements.

    1. Tell the NYT Day Search renderer process about the captcha page and wait
        for a response.
    2. In the NYT Day Search renderer process, listen for the captcha page
        notice.  When received, display a message about the captcha and add
        a button to the NYT Day Search window to be clicked after the captcha
        is solved. When the added button is clicked, send a response to the 
        main process.
    3. When the renderer process response is received by the main process, 
        repeat the articlePage.goto.

02/16/2000 - In processSectionOrKeywords 'await dayPage.goto(url, {waitUntil: "networkidle0"});'
    for url:
    https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=true&endDate=20000216&query=&sections=Food%7Cnyt%3A%2F%2Fsection%2F4f379b11-446b-57ae-8e2a-0cff12e0f26e&sort=best&startDate=20000216

    returns a page with <ol data-testid="search-results" > that has no listitems.

    Should retry dayPage.goto with url:
    https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=true&endDate=20000216&query=&sections=Style%7Cnyt%3A%2F%2Fsection%2F146e2c45-6586-59ef-bc23-90e88fe2cf0a&sort=best&startDate=20000216
