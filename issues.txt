The titleMatch processing in index.js needs review.  The wild population of titles
 should be inventoried.

The Start buttton should be disabled while a recioe search is underway.

Testcase:   1) Because of addition of keyword searches, should check if an
                article has already been recorded.
            2) Integrate testcase here:
                a) add file-choser input from day-search-article-parse-test
                    to index.html
                b) delete input not chosen
                c) move recipeParse and para (and more?) to a separate file
                d) If the file-choser input was chosen, check if a test version
                    of that separate file exists and if so use that.
